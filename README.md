# Wordled game in React Native


## TODO
- save current progress in AsyncStorage, so that if you close the application in the middle of the game, and then relaunch, you continue from where you started. This will prevent cheating. 
- If you add a big dataset of words, you can also check if the entered word is a valid word.
- Keep track of the stats:
  - number of games played
  - win rate
  - current streak
  - max streak

- Animations
  - display of text in the cell
  - add sound effects for game states 'win'/'lose' [https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-play-sounds-in-react-native-using-react-native-sound/] 👍
  - add vibration on key presses 👍


More advance (needs some backend):
- save the stats in a database
- public leaderboard
